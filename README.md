# Turing machine simulator
## Deterministic Turing Machine
A turing machine simulator that accepts a string and processes it according to a given set of transitions.

## Non-Deterministic Turing Machine
Implementation of a non-deterministic turing machine that accepts or rejects string based on a given set of transitions.

In contrast to a deterministic Turing machine, in a nondeterministic Turing machine (NTM) the set of rules may prescribe more than one action to be performed for any given situation. Look main.py for more example

## a sample call of method Non_Deterministic_Turing_Machine
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
